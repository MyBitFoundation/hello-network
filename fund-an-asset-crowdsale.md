# Fund an asset crowdsale

Now, that our "hello world" application has created a deposit account \(i.e. token address\) and provided the terms for the asset crowdsale, investors can fund the purchase of the coffee machine. Once the asset crowdsale is finished, and investors own "shares" in the coffee machine, the revenue generated by this asset is provided to investors in the form dividend issuance. 

Our "hello world" application will decompose the funding in two asynchronous functions: `contribute()` and `fundCoffee()` . The first relates to the investment in the asset. The second executes the funding process end to end, including the execution of `setOperator()` `createAsset()` and the issuance of dividends on the asset. It outputs our first "hello world" application result.

For full detail on `fundCoffee()` function see example.

### Contribute to an asset crowdsale

To contribute to a crowdsale the investor calls asynchronous function `contribute (account, amount)` which parses the investor account and contribution amount. The application checks via the API if the crowdsale is finalised for the `assetID` 

```javascript
crowdsaleFinalized = await api.crowdsaleFinalized(assetID);
```

**If crowdsale is not finalised:**

Then, `approveBurn(account)` function takes the investor address as its parameter. It then sends burn approval to the deployed [MyBitToken](https://github.com/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Network.tech/blob/master/contracts/tokens/erc20/BurnableToken.sol) contract from that investor's address.

```javascript
  await Network.approveBurn(account);
```

Then, the application calls the `fundAsset()` function to finally contribute to the   asset crowdsale and pass the following object:

```javascript
      await Network.fundAsset({
        assetID: assetID,
        amount: amount,
        address: account});
```

Once contributed, the console confirms contribution and amount: 

```javascript
console.log('Contributed ', amount);
```

**Else, if crowdsale is finalised it prints:**

```javascript
console.log('Crowdsale already finished!');
```
